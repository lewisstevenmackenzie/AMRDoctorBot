  utter_initial_symptoms:
    - text: |
        Hi Doctor, I’m not feeling 100% today. I think I might have a cold. I’ve got a runny nose, my throat is also a bit red and sore, and I’ve had a dry cough for a couple of days. Can I have some antibiotics, please?

  utter_why_no_antibiotics:
    - text: |
        Okay, but why would you not give me antibiotics? They’ve worked for me in the past.
  utter_what_is_AMR:
    - text: |
        So, I've heard a lot of people talking about antimicrobial resistance. What is it?
  utter_antibiotic_use:
    - text: |
        Okay but when would you normally prescribe antibiotics?

  utter_alternative_medication:
    - text: |
        Is there any other medication that I can take to make me feel better?
  utter_why_prescribe:
    - text: |
        Thank you, that makes me feel a lot better. I was wondering though, could you could tell me why you are prescribing me antibiotics rather that a different form of medication?
  utter_AMR_concern:
    - text: |
        I've read a lot about something called antimicrobial resistance, should I be concerned about this?
  utter_more_information:
    - text: |
        i'm not sure what more to say, i've just been feeling very poorly and haven't been able to sleep. What sort of things would you look out for when prescribing antibiotics?
  utter_prescription_history:
    - text: |
        no, i've never taken antibiotics before.
  utter_please_rephrase:
    - text: I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand that. Could you rephrase?
